# Level 4 - Baby Steps

### _For players new to C-Warrior_

## Level 4

_You can hear bow strings being stretched._

> **TIP:** No new abilities this time, but you must be careful not to rest while taking damage. Save a `health(Warrior)` variable and compare it on each turn to see if you're taking damage.

### Floor Map
